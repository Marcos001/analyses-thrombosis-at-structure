## Analyses Thrombosis Structure – v1.0

Thanks for your interest.

Blood coagulation is a vital process for humans and other species. Following an injury to a blood vessel, a cascade of molecular signals is transmitted, inhibiting and activating more than a dozen coagulation factors and resulting in the formation of a fibrin clot that ceases the bleeding. In this process, Antithrombin (AT), encoded by the SERPINC1 gene is a key player regulating the clotting activity and ensuring that it stops at the right time. In this sense, mutations to this factor often result in thrombosis - the excessive coagulation that leads to the potentially fatal formation of blood clots that obstruct veins. Although this process is well known, it is still unclear why even single residue substitutions to AT lead to drastically different phenotypes. 

We designed a machine learning framework for the classification of Thombose (Analyses Thrombosis Structure) and although our training data was limited, after careful optimization, Analyzes Thrombosis Structure was able to identify properties related to patterns that quantify the pathology of thrombosis.
